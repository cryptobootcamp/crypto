#  Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
Our topic is about cryptocurrencies specifically starting with bitcoin. We decided to pick it as it is relevant to the modern world, has a lot of data around it, and is a complex topic to work with.
Our source of data for bitcoin was found on Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data. The dataset contains minute intervals of bitcoin data including prices and volume of exchanges.
During the project our team will communicate through a slack group and through use of the git issues board.
